# DUAW

## About
\
Welcome to the DUAW project! DUAW stands for visit, get together and communicate in Bisaya language and is also an abbreviation for the different bootcamp tracks of TechLabs: 

* **D**ata Science
* **U**X Design
* **A**rtificial Intelligence, and 
* **W**eb Development! 

When we started our graduation project, we knew that while there was a place for the documentation of all graduation projects (Github), there wasn't a platform that would allow these projects to get better visually presented and easier for others to discover them.

Indeed, through our interviews with members of the TechLabs leadership team we discovered that final projects often "fizzle out" after graduation, while at the same time students were losing contact with each other. On their side, existing students were already thinking that their projects might not get the visibility and opportunities they deserve.

With these facts, we decided to create a platform where graduation projects can be showcased in a well structured and visualized way and where students can proudly present the skills they gained. Additionally, this platform is targetted in strengthening the TechLabs alumni community. This is made possible by providing project team members with a space to share their personal contact details (e.g. their Linkedin), by enabling the upvoting of projects and allowing interested third parties to contact projects teams with suggestions, feedback or collaboration requests. Last but not least, prospective TechLabs students and partners canv view a vast list of graduation projects, that can help them realise the value that TechLabs offers.

On the technical side, DUAW can be understood as a wrapper for GitHub repos. For projects to be displayed on DUAW, the project teams have to add a few files into the Github repository - as explained on the DUAW website (How it works) - and notify the DUAW team to upload their project. The data is then fetched via the GitHub API and transformed into a new DUAW page for their project.

## Running the project on localhost

After clonning the repository, and having the complete project files saved in a folder on your computer, open the project folder with your desired editor.

To run the frontend part of the project:


To run the backend part of the project:
- To install all the backend dependencies: `npm install`
- run `npm`

To update the recommendations for display on the website:
- The following python packages are needed: `XXXXX`
- execute `recomender-system.ipynb` (in `Jupyter Notebook`)
- update the content of the `recomendations.json` file:  https://github.com/TechLabs-Berlin/wt21-duaw/blob/main/recomendations.json
- the last step will require a pull request and merging by a member of the DUAW team
