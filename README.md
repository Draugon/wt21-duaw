## About
\
Welcome to the DUAW project! DUAW stands for visit, get together and communicate in Bisaya language and is also an abbreviation for the different bootcamp tracks of TechLabs: **D**ata Science, **U**X Design, **A**rtificial Intelligence, and **W**eb Development! \
When we started our graduation project as TechLabs students, we noticed that there is not yet a place where the projects are saved. Indeed, interviewing our TechLabs mentors revealed that often, final projects "fizzle out" after are finished, and same goes for the students that created them. This defined our mission: Creating a platform where the projects can be showcased in a nicely structured and visualized way, so students can proudly present the skills they accomplished. We also want to strengthen the TechLabs community by allowing project members to provide their contact data (e.g. their GitHub Account or their personal portfolio page), upvoting other projects and even allowing interested people to contact the team for suggestions, feedback or collaboration. This especially applies to potential future TechLabs students who can participate in the TechLabs community. They also get a feeling of what the final projects look like and what they will be able to build after finishing their bootcamp.
