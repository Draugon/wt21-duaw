# DUAW

## About
\
Welcome to the DUAW project! DUAW stands for visit, get together and communicate in Bisaya language and is also an abbreviation for the different bootcamp tracks of TechLabs: 
* **D**ata Science
* **U**X Design
* **A**rtificial Intelligence, and 
* **W**eb Development! 

When we started our graduation project, we saw that there is not yet a place where all the projects are presented. Interviewing our TechLabs mentors indeed revealed that often final projects "fizzle out" after being finished, and same goes for the students that created them. This defined our mission: Creating a platform where the projects can be showcased in a nicely structured and visualized way, so students can proudly present the skills they accomplished. We also want to strengthen the TechLabs community by allowing project members to provide their contact data (e.g. their LinkedIn site), by upvoting other projects and even letting interested people contact the team for suggestions, feedback or collaboration. Additionally, potential future TechLabs students see which awesome graduation projects they would be able to build after taking a bootcamp. 

Technically, DUAW can be understood as a wrapper for GitHub repos. The project teams have to add a few files into the repository as explained on the DUAW website, afterwards notify the DUAW team for the project to get uploaded. The data is then fetched via the GitHub API and transformed into a new DUAW page for this project.
